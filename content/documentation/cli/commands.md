# Base Commands

The Buffalo CLI ships with a set of commands that are used to accelerate the development of applications that use the Buffalo framework and libraries. On this page we will describe each of these as well as the options to extend them (when extensible).

## Help
Provides help for a given command or in general about the CLI, This is one of the mandatory commands, every CLI instance has it. When invoked without any arguments it will print the list of available commands. Otherwise will list the help for the given command.

p.e.
```sh
$ buffalo help plugins

Usage: buffalo plugins [options] 

List plugins loaded to the CLI.
```

Interfaces it considers:

- HelpTexter
- LongHelpTexter
- Usager
- Aliaser

## Plugins

The plugins command lists the plugins that the CLI has loaded, his is handy when trying to modify the CLI plugins. It considers the Command interface to sort the plugins by showing first the commands and then the rest. p.e:

```sh
Plugins loaded (38):
  help                 [command]   Provides help for a given command, p.e. buffalo help list.
...
  new                  [command]   Creates a new Buffalo application
  destroy              [command]   Destroys files generated by Buffalo
  build                [command]   Build the application binary, including bundling of webpack assets
  dev                  [command]   Run the Buffalo app in 'development' mode
  db                   [command]   A tasty treat for all your database needs
                                   
  create               [other]     Creates databases for you
  drop                 [other]     Drops databases for you
  fix                  [other]     Brings pop, soda, and fizz files in line with the latest APIs
  migrate              [other]     Runs migrations up or down. Also, provides the status of the migrations.
  reset                [other]     Drop, then recreate databases
...
```

## Test
Runs application tests after invoking the `BeforeTester` plugins. It could be overriden by changing the `Tester` it runs or adding additional testers.

```sh
$ buffalo help test
Usage: buffalo test [options] 

Runs application tests by invoking related plugins.

BeforeTesters:
  test_environment        Sets the GO_ENV environment to be 'test'.
  pop/setup-database      Sets the database up before the tests run.

Testers:
  buffalo/tester       buffalo/tester
```

Interfaces it considers:
- BeforeTester: Plugins to run before running the tests
- Tester: Tests to run.
